Has anyone here tried or used `git`?


# Git: A history

---

Originally written and maintained by Linus Torvalds , who designed the first Linux kernel

![All-around Nice Guy™](../media/linus-eff-you.png)

---

Was designed in order to manage and maintain development of the Linux kernel itself, which is millions of lines of code.

It's free and open-source!

# Git: What is it?

## Git: What is it?

A very powerful "Distributed Version Control System" that allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, and without stepping on each other's toes.

## Git is designed to:

- work on all major operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- keep track of file changes
- be entirely distributed between machines

## Git is designed to:

- allow coders to collaborate on projects
    - effortlessly merge code together
- be quick and stay out of your way
- keep you out of other people's way

## Git is used:

- by big companies for big projects
    - e.g., Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix
- by small teams for small-to-medium-sized projects
- for personal projects; e.g.,
    - profile websites
    - articles and manuscripts

## The most important part: The social side

- huge community with tons of momentum
- it's good to be involved in a vibrant developer community
- you can post your projects online

# Git: The Basics

## Getting started

![Many people tend to look at `git` and say, "Nope."](../media/y-u-so-complicated.png)

## The command line

- installation (from [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com))
- basic commands
    - init
    - add
    - commit
    - status
    - diff

# Beyond the basics

## Branching & merging

Branches (git flow model):

- master
- develop
- others:
    - features
    - bug fixes
    - releases

## Collaboration with Github

- repository setup on your account
- clone, fetch, pull, push
- remote branches
- forking other repositories
    - pull requests

## GIT: GUI-based tools
